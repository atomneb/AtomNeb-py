Python Package for Atomic Data of Ionized Nebulae

### Description

**AtomNeb-py** is a Python package for reading atomic data from *AtomNeb*, which is a database containing atomic data stored in the Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) file format for *collisionally excited lines* and *recombination lines* typically observed in spectra of ionized gaseous nebulae. The AtomNeb database were generated for use in [pyEQUIB](https://github.com/equib/pyEQUIB), [proEQUIB](https://github.com/equib/proEQUIB), and other nebular spectral analysis tools. 

### Installation
