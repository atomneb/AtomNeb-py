This library includes the IDL/GDL version of the program [EQUIB](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ascl.soft03005H), which was originally written in FORTRAN by [Howarth & Adams (1981)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1981ucl..rept.....H), and was recently converted to IDL/GDL.\r\n\r\nWebsite: [physics.mq.edu.au/~ashkbiz/proequib](http://physics.mq.edu.au/~ashkbiz/proequib/)\r\n\r\n### References\r\n* A.
