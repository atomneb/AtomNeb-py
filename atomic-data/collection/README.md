## AtomNeb

**Atomic Data for Ionized Nebulae**

The collection of atomic data was generated for use in [pyEQUIB](https://github.com/equib/pyEQUIB) and [proEQUIB](https://github.com/equib/proEQUIB):

* **AtomElj.fits** contains *Energy Levels* (Ej) obtained from the [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Atomic Spectra Database](https://www.nist.gov/pml/atomic-spectra-database), and some improvements from Cloudy v13.04 and pyNeb v1.0.

* **AtomOmij.fits** contains *Collision Strengths* (Î©ij) obtained from the [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Atomic Spectra Database](https://www.nist.gov/pml/atomic-spectra-database), the [CHIANTI atomic database](http://www.chiantidatabase.org/), and some improved atomic data from Cloudy v13.04 and pyNeb v1.0. 

* **AtomAij.fits** contains *Transition Probabilities* (Aij) obtained from the [National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Atomic Spectra Database](https://www.nist.gov/pml/atomic-spectra-database), the [CHIANTI atomic database](http://www.chiantidatabase.org/), and some improved atomic data from Cloudy v13.04 and pyNeb v1.0.
